# IBM Data Science Capstone

Welcome! This repository holds all of the Jupyter notebooks used to complete the **Applied Data Capstone** course as part of the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate**

This capstone course will summarize and test the knowledge learned for all of the courses of this certification and will mimic a typical data scientist role from data collection to presentation of findings

*Project Scenario:* Students will act as junior data scientists for a private space launch company carrying out the following tasks:
1. Collect data from various sources, either through API or Web Scraping
2. Perform data wrangling to improve data quality 
3. Utilize SQL to get information from the processed data
4. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to see attribute relationships
5. Create a Machine Learning (ML) model predicting the success of a launch
6. Create dashboards and present final results through a Powerpoint presentation
