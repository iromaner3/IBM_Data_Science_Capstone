# IBM Data Science Capstone

Welcome! This repository holds all of the Jupyter notebooks used to complete the **Applied Data Capstone** course as part of the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate**

This capstone course will summarize and test the knowledge learned for all of the courses of this certification and will mimic a typical data scientist role from data collection to presentation of findings

*Project Scenario:* Students will act as junior data scientists for a private space launch company carrying out the following tasks:
1. Collect data from various sources, either through API or Web Scraping
2. Perform data wrangling to improve data quality 
3. Utilize _SQL_ to get information from the processed data
4. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize data and see attribute relationships
5. Create a Machine Learning (ML) model predicting the success of a launch
6. Create dashboards and present final results through a Powerpoint presentation
